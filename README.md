I'm a junior Data Analyst

I've been learning code on Python for 3 years, after switching data analyzed. I've learned libraries like numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, LightGBM, catboost, xgboost. So also I learned how to scrape and parse data from different sources. I used libraries , like selenium and beautifulsoup for solve that problems.

Before I started learning python, I created ads for company at social media (VK,Facebook, IG) and at Google Ads, also  at Yandex direct.
